They have chosen 5 historical novels, each with a different focus: politics, social structures, culture, war, and daily life.

{"prompt":"Math problem: A seasoned mobile app developer is working on optimizing the performance of a new app created by their sibling. The app involves a feature where users can create and share custom animations. Each animation consists of a series of frames, and the app needs to calculate the optimal frame rate (frames per second, FPS) for smooth playback while minimizing battery usage. The app developer decides to use a mathematical model to find the best FPS based on the complexity of the animations. The complexity of an animation is determined by the number of moving objects in each frame, which can be modeled by the function C(n) = n^2 - 3n + 5, where n is the number of frames in the animation. The developer also determines that the battery usage is inversely proportional to the FPS and directly proportional to the complexity of the animation. If the app needs to support animations with up to 10 frames and the developer wants to find the FPS that minimizes battery usage while maintaining smooth playback (at least 30 FPS), what is the optimal FPS for an animation with 10 frames, assuming that the complexity affects the FPS linearly and that the relationship between battery usage, FPS, and complexity can be modeled by the equation: Battery Usage = k * (C(n)\/FPS), where k is a constant?","priority":12800}

She finds a sequence of numbers that represents the number of ways to arrange verses in a poem such that each verse has a unique number of syllables. The number of syllables in each verse ranges from 1 to n, and no two verses can have the same number of syllables. She notices that this is similar to finding the number of permutations of n distinct objects.
